# ScrapingService
<h1>Scraping Service Django</h1>

Scrapy Service Django allows you to create and manage scrapy spiders through the Django Admin dashboard and save the scraped items
into the database defined in Django models.

Scrapy Service Django is well suited for some common scraping tasks, such as extracting a list of items (e.g. news and events) from
the main page, and further fetching more information of each item from the detail page.
